**Purpose:** Automated releases, Docker image publishing, and deployments.

**Jobs:**
- **Create Release** - Automatic changelog generation and GitHub release creation
- **Build & Publish** - Multi-architecture Docker image builds and registry publishing
- **Deploy** - Environment-specific deployments (staging/production)
- **Notify** - Deployment status notifications and summaries

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic semantic versioning
- ‚úÖ Changelog generation from git commits
- ‚úÖ Multi-architecture Docker builds (AMD64, ARM64)
- ‚úÖ GitHub Container Registry publishing
- ‚úÖ Environment-specific deployment strategies
- ‚úÖ Deployment status notifications

### ü§ñ Dependency Management (`dependabot.yml`)

**Purpose:** Automated dependency updates across all package ecosystems.

**Configurations:**
- **Python Backend** - Weekly updates for pip packages with grouping
- **Node.js Frontend** - Weekly updates for npm packages with grouping
- **GitHub Actions** - Weekly updates for action versions
- **Docker** - Weekly updates for base images

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Intelligent package grouping (testing, security, UI, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Configurable update schedules
- ‚úÖ Automatic labeling and assignment
- ‚úÖ Version update type filtering
- ‚úÖ Security-focused dependency management

## üîß Configuration Files

### `dependency-review-config.yml`
Configuration for dependency review action with:
- License allowlist (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, etc.)
- Vulnerability severity thresholds
- Package deny/allow lists
- Custom security policies

### Backend `pyproject.toml` Enhancements
Added comprehensive tool configurations:
- **pytest** - Test discovery, coverage, and reporting
- **coverage** - Branch coverage and exclusion rules  
- **ruff** - Linting and formatting rules
- **mypy** - Type checking configuration

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Required Secrets

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository settings:

```bash
# Optional - for enhanced security scanning
CODECOV_TOKEN=your_codecov_token
SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN=your_semgrep_token  
SNYK_TOKEN=your_snyk_token
GITLEAKS_LICENSE=your_gitleaks_license

# Optional - for testing with real APIs
TAVILY_API_KEY_TEST=your_test_tavily_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY_TEST=your_test_clerk_key
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_TEST=your_test_clerk_key
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Ensure your repository has:
- Protected main branch
- Required status checks enabled
- Branch protection rules configured

### 3. Workflow Permissions

The workflows require these permissions:
- `contents: read/write` (for releases)
- `packages: write` (for Docker registry)
- `security-events: write` (for security scanning)
- `actions: read` (for workflow access)

## üìä Quality Gates

All workflows enforce these quality standards:

### ‚úÖ Code Quality
- All tests must pass (unit, integration, security)
- Code coverage > 80%
- No linting or formatting violations
- TypeScript type checking passes
- No high/critical security vulnerabilities

### ‚úÖ Security Standards
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis (Bandit, Semgrep)
- Container image scanning (Trivy)
- Secret detection (GitLeaks)
- License compliance checking

### ‚úÖ Build Standards
- Multi-architecture Docker builds
- Successful builds across all supported environments
- Integration test validation
- Performance benchmark compliance

## üéØ Workflow Triggers

### Automatic Triggers
- **Push to main/develop** ‚Üí Full CI pipeline + security scan
- **Pull Request** ‚Üí CI pipeline + dependency review
- **Tag creation (v*)** ‚Üí Release pipeline + deployment
- **Daily 2 AM UTC** ‚Üí Security scanning
- **Weekly Tuesday** ‚Üí Dependency updates

### Manual Triggers
- All workflows support `workflow_dispatch` for manual execution
- Release workflow supports custom version and environment inputs
- Security workflow can be triggered for immediate vulnerability assessment

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Workflow Status
- Check the Actions tab for workflow execution status
- Review job summaries for quick status overview
- Download artifacts for detailed analysis

### Security Reports
- Security findings are uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Detailed reports available as workflow artifacts
- Daily security scan summaries in workflow logs

### Coverage Reports
- Codecov integration provides coverage tracking
- HTML coverage reports available as artifacts
- Coverage trends visible in PR comments

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- **UV dependencies** - Cached with lockfile fingerprint
- **npm dependencies** - Cached with package-lock.json
- **Docker layers** - GitHub Actions cache for faster builds
- **Python packages** - Cached for consistent environments

### Parallel Execution
- Matrix testing runs jobs in parallel
- Independent job execution for faster feedback
- Conditional job execution based on changes

### Resource Optimization
- Targeted job execution based on file changes
- Efficient artifact handling and retention
- Optimized Docker layer caching
