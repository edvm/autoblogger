# Enhanced Writing Agent with Directive Support

The Writing Agent has been significantly improved to support directive parsing, allowing users to control content generation behavior through embedded instructions in their topics.

## Overview

With the Editor Agent temporarily disabled, the Writing Agent now serves as both the content creator and finalizer, producing polished, ready-to-publish content directly. The enhanced agent supports directive parsing to customize:

- **Tone**: Writing style and voice
- **Style**: Content structure and approach  
- **Length**: Article length and depth
- **Audience**: Target reader expertise level
- **Format**: Content organization type

## Directive Syntax

Directives are embedded in topic strings using square brackets with either colon or equals syntax:

```
[directive:value] or [directive=value]
```

### Example Usage

```bash
# Basic topic without directives
"Introduction to Machine Learning"

# Topic with tone directive  
"[tone:casual] Python Programming for Beginners"

# Multiple directives
"[tone:technical][style:tutorial][length:detailed] Advanced Docker Orchestration"

# Mixed syntax
"[tone:professional][style=analytical][audience=developers] REST API Design"
```

## Supported Directives

### Tone Directive: `[tone:value]`

Controls the writing voice and personality:

- **professional** (default) - Authoritative, business-appropriate
- **casual** - Friendly, conversational  
- **technical** - Deep technical expertise, precise
- **beginner-friendly** - Simple explanations, jargon-free
- **persuasive** - Compelling, conversion-focused
- **educational** - Teaching-focused, knowledge transfer
- **entertaining** - Engaging, fun to read

### Style Directive: `[style:value]`

Defines content structure and approach:

- **informative** (default) - Clear, well-structured
- **tutorial** - Step-by-step, practical instructions
- **analytical** - Data-driven, thorough analysis  
- **narrative** - Story-driven, engaging flow
- **listicle** - Organized in digestible points
- **comparison** - Evaluative, pros/cons focused
- **guide** - Comprehensive, reference-worthy

### Length Directive: `[length:value]`

Specifies article depth and word count:

- **brief** - Concise (500-800 words)
- **standard** - Standard length (800-1500 words)
- **comprehensive** (default) - Thorough coverage (1500-3000 words)
- **detailed** - In-depth analysis (2000+ words)

### Audience Directive: `[audience:value]`

Targets specific reader expertise levels:

- **general** (default) - Mixed background readers
- **beginners** - Complete newcomers to the topic
- **intermediate** - Some background knowledge
- **advanced** - Experienced practitioners  
- **business** - Business professionals
- **developers** - Software development focus

### Format Directive: `[format:value]`

Determines content organization:

- **article** (default) - Traditional article structure
- **tutorial** - Step-by-step instructions
- **guide** - Comprehensive reference
- **listicle** - Numbered/bulleted format
- **comparison** - Comparative analysis
- **review** - Evaluation with pros/cons
- **howto** - Actionable how-to guide

## Implementation Details

### Directive Parsing

The `parse_topic_directives()` method uses regex patterns to extract directives:

```python
directive_pattern = r'\[(\w+)[=:]([^\]]+)\]'
```

This pattern matches:
- `[tone:casual]` 
- `[style=tutorial]`
- `[length:detailed]`

### Content Customization

Based on parsed directives, the agent customizes:

1. **System Message** - Defines AI persona and writing approach
2. **Content Prompt** - Provides specific instructions for structure and length
3. **Quality Guidelines** - Sets expectations for depth and style

### Clean Topic Extraction

Directives are automatically removed from the topic, leaving a clean subject:

```
Input:  "[tone:casual][style:tutorial] Building REST APIs"
Output: "Building REST APIs" (for content generation)
```

## Usage Examples

### For Beginners Tutorial

```bash
"[tone:beginner-friendly][style:tutorial][audience:beginners][format:guide] Getting Started with Docker"
```

Result: A friendly, step-by-step guide explaining Docker basics without jargon.

### Technical Deep Dive

```bash
"[tone:technical][style:analytical][length:detailed][audience:advanced] Kubernetes Networking Architecture"
```

Result: A comprehensive technical analysis for experienced developers.

### Business Article

```bash
"[tone:professional][style:informative][audience:business][length:standard] Digital Transformation Strategies"
```

Result: A professional business-focused article with practical insights.

### Quick Reference

```bash
"[style:listicle][length:brief][format:guide] Top 10 Python Libraries for Data Science"
```

Result: A concise, well-organized list with brief explanations.

## Editor Agent Integration

With the Editor Agent temporarily disabled, the Writing Agent now:

1. **Generates draft content** based on research and directives
2. **Sets final_content** directly (bypassing editing phase)
3. **Ensures publication-ready quality** through enhanced prompting

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Precise Control** - Customize content to exact requirements
- **Consistency** - Predictable output based on directives  
- **Flexibility** - Mix and match directives for unique combinations
- **Efficiency** - Single-agent workflow when editing isn't needed

### For Content Quality
- **Targeted Writing** - Content matches intended audience and purpose
- **Appropriate Tone** - Voice matches brand or context requirements
- **Optimal Structure** - Format aligns with content goals
- **Right Length** - Depth matches reader expectations

## Logging and Debugging

The enhanced agent provides detailed logging:

```
Writing Agent: Parsed directives - tone: casual, style: tutorial, length: standard
Writing Agent: Final content created (Editor Agent disabled)
```

This helps track how directives are being interpreted and applied.

## Testing

Use the provided test script to experiment with directives:

```bash
python test_writing_agent.py
```

This script demonstrates directive parsing and shows how different combinations affect content generation.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple** - Begin with one or two directives
2. **Match Audience** - Align tone and audience directives  
3. **Consider Purpose** - Choose format based on content goals
4. **Test Combinations** - Experiment with directive pairings
5. **Monitor Results** - Check logs to verify directive application

## Migration Notes

Existing topics without directives continue to work with default settings:
- tone: professional
- style: informative  
- length: comprehensive
- audience: general
- format: article

This ensures backward compatibility while adding new customization capabilities.
